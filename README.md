# Bioinformatics-Web-ML-Project
This web-based project uses Flask to predict Gene Ontology (GO) terms for proteins based on their amino acid composition. It employs a RandomForestClassifier trained on AAC features, enhanced with SMOTE for handling class imbalance. Users can upload CSV files containing protein data, and the model returns predicted GO terms in JSON format.
